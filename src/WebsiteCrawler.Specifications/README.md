# WebsiteCrawler.Specifications

WebsiteCrawler.Specifications contains all specifications for WebsiteCrawler console application.

All tests are "black box" tests, i.e. the tests know nothing about the implementation of specifications. This project references WebsiteCrawler.Console for the sole purpose of running the application. The tests must only call **WebsiteCrawler.Console.Program.Main(string[] args)**.
